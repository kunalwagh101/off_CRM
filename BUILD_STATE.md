# BUILD_STATE.md

Working record for the off_CRM AI orchestration module. Read **this file** to
recover context between sessions rather than re-reading the codebase.

Last updated: 2026-07-30
Branch: `claude/recall-sent-mail`
Tests: **258 Python passed**, 6 frontend passed, 1 pre-existing failure
(`test_discovery.py::test_scrapling_parser…` — optional `Scrapling` dependency
is not in `requirements.txt`; unrelated to this work and failing before it too).

---

## 1. What this module is

An AI layer inside off_CRM that runs outreach cheaply across many providers,
where the owner's mailbox, CRM database and context layers are **structurally**
unable to reach any provider.

The governing rule: **models never pull, off_CRM pushes.** A model that can
*ask* for data has access. A model that can only *receive* a constructed payload
does not.

config/providers.yaml               ← the registry. Adding a provider is a
                                       config edit, never a code change (§4E)
```

The module depends on the CRM only through `outreach/models.py` (dataclasses)
and `outreach/providers.py` (HTTP adapters). Lifting it into its own repo means
taking those two seams with it.

### The call path

```
caller → EgressRequest (task_type, data_class, person, template…)
       → broker.plan()      1. tier filter   ← runs FIRST, cost cannot override
                            2. quota filter
                            3. same-tier-only chain
       → build_payload()    4. construct from empty, per resolved policy
       → scan_payload()     5. block + raise on any hit
       → provider.generate  6. call
       → log.record()       7. record provider, tier, exact payload, timestamp
```

### Trust tiers (owner's ordering, 2026-07-25)

| Tier | Who | Policy ceiling | May receive |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | Europe, self-hosted | full | public, person, campaign, CRM internal |
| B | USA, Canada, allied | standard | public, person, campaign |
| C | China, and anything demoted for weak data terms | minimal | public, person's public profile |
| D | Routers/aggregators, anything unlisted | strict | nothing |

Tier is derived from **two axes** — jurisdiction *and* retention terms. Passing
one is not enough. Google's free tier sits at C despite being US-based, because
its terms allow training on submitted content.

### Data policies (least → most)

| Policy | Sends |
|---|---|
| `strict` | Category and question structure. Nobody identifiable. |
| `minimal` | The person's public name, company, title, hook + your positioning line. Addresses tokenised. |
| `standard` | Above + your template text and campaign notes. Addresses tokenised. |
| `full` | No field restrictions. Real addresses can leave. Explicit opt-in. |

**Note on `minimal`:** it deliberately permits the person's public name so
enrichment can personalise — the owner's instruction. The older
`outreach/providers.py` path keeps its own stricter meaning for `minimal`; the
two are documented separately so existing profiles never silently widen.

`full` stays available on any tier via a recorded override with a mandatory
reason. Credentials, mailbox headers and internal field names are blocked at
**every** policy level including `full`.

---

## 3. Done

### Security core (§5)
- [x] Single egress gate. `create_provider` is reachable only from `ai/broker.py`,
      `outreach/providers.py` and `outreach/provider_profiles.py`; enforced by
      an AST test that walks every module.
- [x] Two former bypasses fixed: `api/app.py` (request-supplied provider) and
      `outreach_cli.py` now go through `create_guarded_provider`, which cannot
      return an unwrapped provider.
- [x] Payload **construction** replaces filtering. `PersonPublic` has no email
      field, so an address cannot arrive through the person path at all.
- [x] Pre-flight scanner blocks and raises. Catches addresses, owner domains,
      credentials (12 shapes), mail headers, internal field names, env vars,
      local paths.
- [x] Trust tiers on both axes, with per-model provenance caps (a US host
      serving a Chinese-origin model is capped at C).
- [x] Default-deny: an unlisted provider raises rather than being assumed safe.
- [x] Fail-closed: unknown tier, empty candidate set and exhausted quota all
      stop the call.
- [x] Failover never crosses a tier boundary.
- [x] Mailbox is unreachable by default for every provider; unlock needs the
      exact phrase `ALLOW MAILBOX CONTENT TO LEAVE`, and even then tier C is
      still refused.
- [x] Egress log with the exact payload + inspector UI (`#egress`).
- [x] Credential isolation: Fernet, `0600`, per workspace, env fallback.
- [x] §5.12 acceptance tests — 30 cases in `tests/test_ai_egress_wall.py`.

### Run modes (owner's design, 2026-07-25)
- [x] **Simple** — one model, cheapest permitted. The everyday path.
- [x] **Compare** — every permitted model answers at once, side by side. Each
      runs under *its own* policy, so a tier C model can contribute without
      seeing more than it should. Capped at 8 branches so one question cannot
      burn every quota.
- [x] **Orchestrated** — a head model writes a plan, each step routes normally.
      **The head model must be tier A or B.** Planning means seeing the whole
      job, so restricted models get steps to do, never the job to split.
      A plan cannot widen its own reach: a step asking for `mailbox` or
      `internal` is clamped to what the caller already offered.
- [x] Model strip in the AI screen: every connected AI, its trust badge, and a
      meter showing how close it is to its daily limit.

### Per-model connectors (2026-07-26)
- [x] A connector is a **key**, and a key reaches many models. One NVIDIA key
      offers Llama, DeepSeek, Qwen, Phi, Gemma, Granite, Mistral, Nemotron.
- [x] **Tier belongs to the model, not the key.** NVIDIA+Llama is B,
      NVIDIA+DeepSeek is C — in the same run, on the same key.
- [x] `model_origin_rules` in config classify a model by name prefix. The
      provider supplies names; config decides trust. Unmatched name -> tier D.
- [x] "Find models" calls the provider's `/models` endpoint. Sends no owner
      data; still written to the egress log so the record stays complete.
      Degrades to the config list on any failure, with the reason shown.
- [x] Connecting a model off_CRM cannot place is refused with the fix in the
      message, rather than failing later at call time.
- [x] **Per-model `request_options` in config** — `max_tokens`, `temperature`,
      and provider-specific keys such as NVIDIA's `reasoning_budget`. A large
      reasoning model with no `max_tokens` gets truncated by the provider's
      own default, so this is correctness, not tuning. Options are opt-in per
      model; models that declare none send a plain payload.
- [x] Reasoning models handled: `reasoning_content` is returned when
      `content` is empty, and `finish_reason: length` produces an error that
      names `max_tokens` as the fix instead of "no message content".
- [x] Nemotron Ultra 550B and DeepSeek R1 seeded with working options.
- [x] **Image generation.** Models carry `kind: chat | image`; image models
      go to `/images/generations` and return pictures. Same key, same tier
      rules, same scanner, same log — a prompt is text, so a prompt naming a
      real person is still person data. FLUX (German) and Stable Diffusion
      (British) seeded on the NVIDIA key with origin rules for their makers.
      Pictures come back as base64 so they never sit behind a provider URL;
      the image itself is not written to the egress log, only the prompt and
      a count, since the log exists to show what *left*.

### Fixed in this round
- [x] **The chosen model was ignored.** `candidates_for` resolved each provider
      with no model id, so every call fell back to `default_model` — and the
      provenance cap was therefore unreachable from the UI: picking a Chinese
      model on NVIDIA was treated as tier B. Three call sites had the same gap
      (broker, compare, orchestrated planner); all now route per model, each
      with a regression test.

### Features
- [x] §4B Connectors: own screen; Gmail moved out of Settings; every provider
      card shows **country, trust tier, retention terms**, usage and cost.
- [x] §4C AI chat: model selector, task mode, Markdown/HTML export, dictation
      where the browser supports it (degrades silently where it does not).
- [x] §4E config-driven registry: 17 providers in YAML with jurisdiction,
      retention, RPM/RPD, context window, cost, `verified_on` date.
- [x] §4E local quota counting + usage display + same-tier failover.
- [x] §4L: structured refusals surface as readable sentences with a next step,
      never a raw status code. Every empty state has an action.

### Context layer (§4F/§4H) — built

- [x] `ai/context.py` — job state (steps, decisions, facts) plus a **rolling
      summary assembled by Python**, not written by a model. Same inputs, same
      summary; no per-update AI cost and no drift.
- [x] Decisions survive a model swap mid-job, which is the point of the layer:
      the head model can change without the choices being quietly undone.
- [x] Reply-rate counting per template and variant. A template is not judged
      until 20 sends, so one lucky reply out of two is never a "50% success".
- [x] Weak templates (judged, at or under 5%) can be rewritten. The request that
      leaves carries **the template wording and two numbers** — no recipient, no
      name, no address — so it runs as public work under any permitted model.
- [x] Nothing goes live automatically. A rewrite is shown for approval and saved
      as a new variant to run against the old one.
- [x] The winning template is offered to other models as a reference to follow
      or beat (owner's request).
- [x] **Wired into the real send path.** `OutreachEngine` counts a send when the
      message actually leaves and a reply against the template that was sent —
      not the contact's current stage, which has usually moved on. The unattended
      automation sender counts too. A counter failure can never lose a send.
- [x] Two safety rules with their own tests: **no model can query this store**
      (no tool, no function, no retrieval interface, no provider import), and
      **only code writes to it** — so the numbers stay facts.
- [x] `record_reply` takes no reply text. Detecting that a reply arrived is a
      fact; reading what it says would be mailbox content leaving. There is
      nowhere to put it.
- [x] Memory screen in the UI: reply rates, weak flags, the rewrite awaiting
      approval, and jobs in progress.
- [x] This is **not fine-tuning**. No data is shipped away to retrain anything.

### Recall over sent mail (RAG) — built

Retrieval where the access rules, not the search, were the work. A normal RAG
stack leaks in four places; each is closed by construction here.

- [x] `ai/recall.py` — local full-text search (SQLite FTS5) over the owner's own
      sent mail. **No embeddings, no API key, no network call.** Indexing the
      whole archive posts nothing to anyone and works offline.
- [x] **Redacted before it is stored, not on the way out.** Most stacks keep the
      raw text and clean it at query time, which makes the index the most
      dangerous file in the product. Here names, companies, addresses, phone
      numbers and links are removed before the write. A test reads the raw bytes
      of the database file and asserts no identity survives in it.
- [x] Redaction is **targeted, not guessed**: off_CRM knows exactly who its
      contacts are, so it deletes their names precisely. The vocabulary covers
      *every* contact, not just the recipient — an email to one person routinely
      names another. A pattern pass then catches what no contact list could know.
- [x] Over-redaction is the deliberate choice where the two disagree. A common
      first name is removed even though it costs a legitimate word sometimes.
      Dates are kept: a date identifies nobody and losing them makes the
      snippets useless.
- [x] **Sent mail only, enforced twice.** `index_message` refuses an inbound row,
      and `store.sent_messages` filters to outbound in the SQL with no parameter
      that could switch it.
- [x] **Quoted threads are cut off first.** A follow-up usually quotes the reply
      underneath it — that block is *their* mail inside *your* mail, and it never
      reaches the index.
- [x] **No model can search it.** No tool, no function, no retrieval interface,
      no provider import, no network import. off_CRM chooses the search, reads
      the result and pushes a payload. Asserted structurally.
- [x] Snippets leave as `DataClass.CAMPAIGN` — the honest label for the owner's
      own business writing. Calling it `public` would have smuggled it past the
      rule keeping campaign material from restricted providers. **Two
      independent barriers, neither special-cased for this feature:** tier C and
      D refuse the class outright, and the snippets travel as `prior_drafts`,
      which a `minimal` policy does not carry at all.
- [x] The payload is still scanned on the way out, so a regression in redaction
      blocks the call rather than leaking.
- [x] Wired into the live send path and the unattended sender. A reply sets a
      "this one worked" flag and is otherwise not stored, which makes
      "show me emails like this that actually earned replies" possible.
- [x] Deletion: forget one message, forget one person, or clear everything.
      Redaction is not an answer to a deletion request.
- [x] Past emails screen: search, and a preview that renders the **real**
      outbound payload rather than a description of it.

### Fixed defects found during the audit
- [x] **AI chat leaked.** It passed the raw conversation to a provider with no
      policy applied, while its own docstring claimed the opposite. Chat now
      goes through the broker. `ai_chat.py` no longer imports any transport, and
      a test asserts it never will again.
- [x] **Scanner newline bug.** Patterns ran against a JSON dump, which escapes
      `\n` and silently disabled every `^`-anchored mail-header rule — the
      payload looked clean exactly when it held a pasted email. Patterns now run
      against raw string values.
- [x] Removed `frontend/src/providerCatalog.ts`, which hardcoded providers in
      TypeScript and recommended DeepSeek for "bulk email generation".

## 4. Not built yet

Listed honestly. Nothing below is silently assumed done.

| § | Item | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 4D | Two-mode campaign intake | Deterministic CSV/XLSX parsing already exists in `input_loader.py`; the Generate/Parse-and-send split and PDF intake are not built. |
| 4G | NotebookLM export | Notion export exists (`outreach/notion.py`). |
| 4H | Bandit / automatic traffic shifting | The rewrite loop is built (see §3); choosing the split automatically is not. A rewrite is offered, never applied — the owner approves the wording. |
| 4J | Bring-your-own tools, sandboxed | Not started. **§5.12(c) container network isolation is therefore untested.** |
| 4K | Graphify | Not started. |
| — | Postgres | Still SQLite. Fine for local and small teams; a shared multi-user server needs Postgres. Storage is behind a boundary, so it is a swap not a rewrite. |
| 10 | Rebuild guide | Produced last, per the brief. Not yet written. |

---

## 5. Decisions and why

1. **`full` policy kept as a user choice.** The brief said addresses never leave;
   the owner overrode that and asked to keep the freedom. Implemented as: full
   is available on any tier, but above a tier's ceiling it needs an override
   with a written reason, stored with who decided and when. Never silent, never
   a default, never reached by failover.
2. **Chinese providers stay enabled and useful.** At tier C they receive a
   person's public name, company and title — which is what personalisation
   actually needs — plus public and coding work. They never receive the owner's
   address, template, notes or mailbox unless explicitly raised.
3. **Google demoted to C.** Acceptable jurisdiction, but free-tier terms permit
   training on input. If billing moves to paid, re-verify and pin `trust_tier: B`
   with a note.
4. **SQLite kept.** Swapping the 2,221-line store to Postgres mid-hardening
   would have risked 88 passing tests for no security gain. Flagged above.
5. **Per-workspace, not global.** Multi-user from the start: one colleague
   raising a provider cannot change what another's calls send.
6. **Log payloads on by default.** The older audit defaulted to off, which meant
   it could only report "42 characters were sent" — useless for the question the
   owner actually has. Bounded at 20k rows.

---

## 6. Open questions for the owner

1. **Recall coverage** — the index covers sent mail. Whether attachments and
   older archives outside off_CRM should be pulled in is an owner decision.
2. **Orchestrator** — confirm the §7 reversal, and which model is the head.
3. **Positioning line** — set per workspace in Connectors; no default shipped.
4. **Render deployment** — `render.yaml` deploys `branch: main` with
   `autoDeploy: true`, so nothing ships until this branch is merged there.
   Two things to set up before the first deploy:
   - Provider keys as environment variables `OFFSETX_AI_<PROVIDER>_KEY`
     (e.g. `OFFSETX_AI_MISTRAL_KEY`). `OFFSETX_DATA_DIR` points at `/tmp`
     on Render, which is wiped on every restart, so the encrypted key file
     will not survive. The env fallback is why keys still work there.
   - **The egress log lives in the same disposable `/tmp` directory.** It is
     the audit trail, and on Render it resets on every restart. Fine for a
     demo; a real shared deployment needs a Render disk or Postgres.
5. **Postgres** — needed before "millions of users"; say when.

---

## 7. How to verify the wall yourself

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_ai_egress_wall.py -v   # 30 security cases
python -m pytest tests/test_ai_api.py -v           # 15 API cases
```

Then in the app: **Connectors** → connect a provider → **What was sent** →
Inspect any row. The payload shown is byte-for-byte what left the machine.
