# BUILD_STATE.md

Working record for the off_CRM AI orchestration module. Read **this file** to
recover context between sessions rather than re-reading the codebase.

Last updated: 2026-07-25
Branch: `claude/ai-module-hardening`
Tests: **165 Python passed**, 6 frontend passed, 1 pre-existing failure
(`test_discovery.py::test_scrapling_parser…` — optional `Scrapling` dependency
is not in `requirements.txt`; unrelated to this work and failing before it too).

---

## 1. What this module is

An AI layer inside off_CRM that runs outreach cheaply across many providers,
where the owner's mailbox, CRM database and context layers are **structurally**
unable to reach any provider.

The governing rule: **models never pull, off_CRM pushes.** A model that can
*ask* for data has access. A model that can only *receive* a constructed payload
does not.

---

## 2. Architecture as built

```
offsetx_apollo_builder/ai/          ← self-contained, extractable (§4M)
├── tiers.py      trust tiers, data classes, policy levels, the rules between them
├── registry.py   reads config/providers.yaml; resolves provider + owner override
├── payload.py    builds outbound payloads from an ALLOWLIST, starting empty
├── scanner.py    pre-flight scan; a hit BLOCKS and raises, never redacts
├── quota.py      local RPM/RPD/spend accounting, file-backed
├── broker.py     THE single egress gate — the only code that calls a provider
├── modes.py      run modes: simple, compare, orchestrated
├── log.py        egress log; own SQLite table, stores the exact payload
├── workspace.py  per-workspace settings + Fernet-encrypted provider keys
└── errors.py     structured refusals the API turns into readable answers

config/providers.yaml               ← the registry. Adding a provider is a
                                       config edit, never a code change (§4E)
```

The module depends on the CRM only through `outreach/models.py` (dataclasses)
and `outreach/providers.py` (HTTP adapters). Lifting it into its own repo means
taking those two seams with it.

### The call path

```
caller → EgressRequest (task_type, data_class, person, template…)
       → broker.plan()      1. tier filter   ← runs FIRST, cost cannot override
                            2. quota filter
                            3. same-tier-only chain
       → build_payload()    4. construct from empty, per resolved policy
       → scan_payload()     5. block + raise on any hit
       → provider.generate  6. call
       → log.record()       7. record provider, tier, exact payload, timestamp
```

### Trust tiers (owner's ordering, 2026-07-25)

| Tier | Who | Policy ceiling | May receive |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | Europe, self-hosted | full | public, person, campaign, CRM internal |
| B | USA, Canada, allied | standard | public, person, campaign |
| C | China, and anything demoted for weak data terms | minimal | public, person's public profile |
| D | Routers/aggregators, anything unlisted | strict | nothing |

Tier is derived from **two axes** — jurisdiction *and* retention terms. Passing
one is not enough. Google's free tier sits at C despite being US-based, because
its terms allow training on submitted content.

### Data policies (least → most)

| Policy | Sends |
|---|---|
| `strict` | Category and question structure. Nobody identifiable. |
| `minimal` | The person's public name, company, title, hook + your positioning line. Addresses tokenised. |
| `standard` | Above + your template text and campaign notes. Addresses tokenised. |
| `full` | No field restrictions. Real addresses can leave. Explicit opt-in. |

**Note on `minimal`:** it deliberately permits the person's public name so
enrichment can personalise — the owner's instruction. The older
`outreach/providers.py` path keeps its own stricter meaning for `minimal`; the
two are documented separately so existing profiles never silently widen.

`full` stays available on any tier via a recorded override with a mandatory
reason. Credentials, mailbox headers and internal field names are blocked at
**every** policy level including `full`.

---

## 3. Done

### Security core (§5)
- [x] Single egress gate. `create_provider` is reachable only from `ai/broker.py`,
      `outreach/providers.py` and `outreach/provider_profiles.py`; enforced by
      an AST test that walks every module.
- [x] Two former bypasses fixed: `api/app.py` (request-supplied provider) and
      `outreach_cli.py` now go through `create_guarded_provider`, which cannot
      return an unwrapped provider.
- [x] Payload **construction** replaces filtering. `PersonPublic` has no email
      field, so an address cannot arrive through the person path at all.
- [x] Pre-flight scanner blocks and raises. Catches addresses, owner domains,
      credentials (12 shapes), mail headers, internal field names, env vars,
      local paths.
- [x] Trust tiers on both axes, with per-model provenance caps (a US host
      serving a Chinese-origin model is capped at C).
- [x] Default-deny: an unlisted provider raises rather than being assumed safe.
- [x] Fail-closed: unknown tier, empty candidate set and exhausted quota all
      stop the call.
- [x] Failover never crosses a tier boundary.
- [x] Mailbox is unreachable by default for every provider; unlock needs the
      exact phrase `ALLOW MAILBOX CONTENT TO LEAVE`, and even then tier C is
      still refused.
- [x] Egress log with the exact payload + inspector UI (`#egress`).
- [x] Credential isolation: Fernet, `0600`, per workspace, env fallback.
- [x] §5.12 acceptance tests — 30 cases in `tests/test_ai_egress_wall.py`.

### Run modes (owner's design, 2026-07-25)
- [x] **Simple** — one model, cheapest permitted. The everyday path.
- [x] **Compare** — every permitted model answers at once, side by side. Each
      runs under *its own* policy, so a tier C model can contribute without
      seeing more than it should. Capped at 8 branches so one question cannot
      burn every quota.
- [x] **Orchestrated** — a head model writes a plan, each step routes normally.
      **The head model must be tier A or B.** Planning means seeing the whole
      job, so restricted models get steps to do, never the job to split.
      A plan cannot widen its own reach: a step asking for `mailbox` or
      `internal` is clamped to what the caller already offered.
- [x] Model strip in the AI screen: every connected AI, its trust badge, and a
      meter showing how close it is to its daily limit.

### Features
- [x] §4B Connectors: own screen; Gmail moved out of Settings; every provider
      card shows **country, trust tier, retention terms**, usage and cost.
- [x] §4C AI chat: model selector, task mode, Markdown/HTML export, dictation
      where the browser supports it (degrades silently where it does not).
- [x] §4E config-driven registry: 17 providers in YAML with jurisdiction,
      retention, RPM/RPD, context window, cost, `verified_on` date.
- [x] §4E local quota counting + usage display + same-tier failover.
- [x] §4L: structured refusals surface as readable sentences with a next step,
      never a raw status code. Every empty state has an action.

### Fixed defects found during the audit
- [x] **AI chat leaked.** It passed the raw conversation to a provider with no
      policy applied, while its own docstring claimed the opposite. Chat now
      goes through the broker. `ai_chat.py` no longer imports any transport, and
      a test asserts it never will again.
- [x] **Scanner newline bug.** Patterns ran against a JSON dump, which escapes
      `\n` and silently disabled every `^`-anchored mail-header rule — the
      payload looked clean exactly when it held a pasted email. Patterns now run
      against raw string values.
- [x] Removed `frontend/src/providerCatalog.ts`, which hardcoded providers in
      TypeScript and recommended DeepSeek for "bulk email generation".

## 4. Not built yet

Listed honestly. Nothing below is silently assumed done.

| § | Item | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 4D | Two-mode campaign intake | Deterministic CSV/XLSX parsing already exists in `input_loader.py`; the Generate/Parse-and-send split and PDF intake are not built. |
| 4F | Runtime task/plan state + rolling summary | `outreach/memory.py` is an evidence store, not the orchestration state store. |
| 4G | NotebookLM export | Notion export exists (`outreach/notion.py`). |
| 4H | Auto-rewrite of losing variants + bandit | Reply-rate measurement and A/B with Wilson intervals exist; the trigger loop does not. |
| 4J | Bring-your-own tools, sandboxed | Not started. **§5.12(c) container network isolation is therefore untested.** |
| 4K | Graphify | Not started. |
| — | Context layer: learning loop + template memory | Agreed with owner. Next piece. Tracks which template earns replies, rewrites the weak ones, and offers the winning template to other models as a reference they may use or beat. |
| — | RAG over redacted sent-mail history | Agreed with owner. Search runs locally; results pass through the same egress gate. |
| — | Postgres | Still SQLite. Fine for local and small teams; a shared multi-user server needs Postgres. Storage is behind a boundary, so it is a swap not a rewrite. |
| 10 | Rebuild guide | Produced last, per the brief. Not yet written. |

## 5. Decisions and why

1. **`full` policy kept as a user choice.** The brief said addresses never leave;
   the owner overrode that and asked to keep the freedom. Implemented as: full
   is available on any tier, but above a tier's ceiling it needs an override
   with a written reason, stored with who decided and when. Never silent, never
   a default, never reached by failover.
2. **Chinese providers stay enabled and useful.** At tier C they receive a
   person's public name, company and title — which is what personalisation
   actually needs — plus public and coding work. They never receive the owner's
   address, template, notes or mailbox unless explicitly raised.
3. **Google demoted to C.** Acceptable jurisdiction, but free-tier terms permit
   training on input. If billing moves to paid, re-verify and pin `trust_tier: B`
   with a note.
4. **SQLite kept.** Swapping the 2,221-line store to Postgres mid-hardening
   would have risked 88 passing tests for no security gain. Flagged above.
5. **Per-workspace, not global.** Multi-user from the start: one colleague
   raising a provider cannot change what another's calls send.
6. **Log payloads on by default.** The older audit defaulted to off, which meant
   it could only report "42 characters were sent" — useless for the question the
   owner actually has. Bounded at 20k rows.

---

## 6. Open questions for the owner

1. **Context layer / RAG** — design proposal owed before building (§4F/§2).
2. **Orchestrator** — confirm the §7 reversal, and which model is the head.
3. **Positioning line** — set per workspace in Connectors; no default shipped.
4. **Render deployment** — `render.yaml` deploys `branch: main` with
   `autoDeploy: true`, so nothing ships until this branch is merged there.
   Two things to set up before the first deploy:
   - Provider keys as environment variables `OFFSETX_AI_<PROVIDER>_KEY`
     (e.g. `OFFSETX_AI_MISTRAL_KEY`). `OFFSETX_DATA_DIR` points at `/tmp`
     on Render, which is wiped on every restart, so the encrypted key file
     will not survive. The env fallback is why keys still work there.
   - **The egress log lives in the same disposable `/tmp` directory.** It is
     the audit trail, and on Render it resets on every restart. Fine for a
     demo; a real shared deployment needs a Render disk or Postgres.
5. **Postgres** — needed before "millions of users"; say when.

## 7. How to verify the wall yourself

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_ai_egress_wall.py -v   # 30 security cases
python -m pytest tests/test_ai_api.py -v           # 15 API cases
```

Then in the app: **Connectors** → connect a provider → **What was sent** →
Inspect any row. The payload shown is byte-for-byte what left the machine.
